# Project Title: Digital and Wireless Communications in Information Theory
* We are simulating a 3G mobile communication system. We are going to send an audio signal using a transmitter. Pass the signal across different channels, and finally receive the signal using the receiver. 
## Description:

This project entails the comprehensive study and implementation of a digital passband wireless communication system, focusing on both theoretical understanding and practical application. The project encompasses the design and realization of a transmission (Tx) and reception (Rx) system using both MATLAB simulations and Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) hardware. The primary objectives include:

### System Design and Implementation:
* Selection of a digital passband communication system.
* Development of both Tx and Rx components utilizing MATLAB simulations and USRP hardware.
* Transmission of real messages (voice or video) through the selected passband communication system.
### Analysis of System Performance:
* Evaluation of the digital communication system in the presence and absence of noise and wireless channel impairments such as multi-path fading and shadowing.
* Conducting MATLAB simulations under various conditions, including different Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR) and fading models (Rayleigh and Rician).
### Key Specifications:
* Pulse shape of base-band pulse: Root-raised cosine (RRC) with roll-off Î± = 0.22.
* Modulation type: Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK).
* Bit rate: Up to 2 Mbit/s.
* Channel bandwidth: 5 MHz.
* Frequency bands: Uplink (1920-1980 MHz) and downlink (2110-2170 MHz).
### MATLAB Simulation Approach:
* Simulation of Tx and Rx systems by incorporating system specifications.
* Transmission of video, image, or audio through a wireless channel with and without noise, utilizing MATLAB.
* Investigation of received signals under different AWGN and channel conditions.
### USRP Implementation:
* Implementation of the selected digital communication system using USRP hardware.
### Outcome:
